Once intended to be a massive, paid framework, odin is now an open source project for any and all to use / contribute towards. 

Odin is intended to be very modular -- ideally, systems do not rely upon eachother unless they absolutely have to. As an example, it would be silly not have the NPC and quest system work hand in hand, but the lighting system has no reason to interfere with the finite state machine. 

Odin was originally intended to be a complete foundation that people could use to accelerate their game development process, only needing to add their content and personal touch to the game. Now, it serves best as a reference for those trying to learn to make these same systems, or for those who are tired of writing the same things over and over again.

This is still very much in a WIP state -- I can't guarantee that these are the *best* ways to do each respective task.
