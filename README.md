<h1 align="center">odin</h1>
<h3 align="center>a flexible RPG framework for GameMaker Studio 2</h3>

Once intended to be a massive, paid framework, odin is now an open source project for any and all to use / contribute towards. 

This is still very much in a WIP state -- I can't guarentee that these are the *best* ways to do each respective task. But it can hopefully serve as a foundation to build games upon, or as reference for learning GM.

Included systems are:

* Camera
* Display
* Finite State Machine
* Inputs
* NPCs
* Quests
* Toast Notifications
* Inventory
* Saving / Loading
* Lighting
* Movement / Collisions
